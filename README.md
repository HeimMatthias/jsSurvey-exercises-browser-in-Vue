# my-Plattform exercises in SurveyJS

This is a basic Vue 3 setup from which you can browse exercises from all four my-plattforms.

For your convencience, the exercises have been translated with Deepl. The copyright for the exercises remains with hep Verlag AG.

## Usage

Exercises are loaded from static JSON-files with SurveyJS. Some have sample user-data associated with them; these exercises are listed in blue in the drop-down selector. You can export the user-data as json-files at the press of a button. Your own user input is saved to localstorage only.

The exercises with predefined user-data give a fairly good overview of the variety of exercises on the plattforms.

## Missing Feature

The only key-feature missing on the sample implementation is a button to present the solution to the user. This is not implemented here, as this is not a standard feature of SurveyJS. This has, however been implemented on the my-plattform.
