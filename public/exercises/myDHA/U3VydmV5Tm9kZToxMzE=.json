Remo causes a rear-end collision with damage to the car in front and to his own car. The insurance covers both damages. However, Remo has an additional excess of CHF 1,000 for both third-party liability and fully comprehensive cover because he is a new driver. In addition, he is upgraded from B8 to B12 for both third-party liability and fully comprehensive insurance, which means a new level of 120% for this insurance.",
