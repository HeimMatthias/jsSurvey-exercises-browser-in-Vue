In a general partnership, on the other hand, each general partner is entitled and obliged to manage the company. \n- Anonymity: This is guaranteed with the AG, whereas with the general partnership the partners are visible in the commercial register. \n- Financing: The legal form of the AG allows more generous solutions for raising funds than the general partnership, which is dependent on the partners' assets. \n- Tax aspects: The AG is subject to double taxation, i.e. profits must be taxed both by the company and by the shareholders. The general partnership, on the other hand, offers tax advantages.",
