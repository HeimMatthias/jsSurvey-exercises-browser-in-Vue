With contactless payment, no PIN entry is required for amounts under CHF 80. The retailer receives online approval for the amount to be charged from the relevant credit card organization. In rare cases, the cardholder's signature is required instead of entering the PIN. In this case, the original purchase receipt remains with the seller, while the credit card organization and the buyer each receive a copy. Billing usually takes place at the end of the month.",
