If reference is made there to the Swiss Code of Obligations, this means that the notice period is one month in the first year of employment, two months in the second year of employment and three months from the 10th year of employment. Eugen must therefore work at No Name until the end of February 2023, as the notice of termination is a letter that must be received. A postmark of November 30 means that the notice of termination will not arrive until December.",
