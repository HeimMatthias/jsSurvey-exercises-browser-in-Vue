This involves calculating the average amount of productive land (arable land, pasture, forest, rivers, etc.) a person uses for food, energy, housing and other material goods, as well as for the decomposition of waste.",

              "correctAnswer": "The ecological footprint also calculates the \"biocapacity\", i.e. the ability of nature to produce raw materials and break down pollutants. If the footprint and biocapacity of a region match, it is in harmony with the carrying capacity of nature and is sustainable.",
