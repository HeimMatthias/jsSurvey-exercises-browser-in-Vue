This is the portion that the other party's motor vehicle liability insurance does not have to pay because the person involved in the accident is at fault to a certain extent. The greater your own fault, the greater your own damage. Legal expenses insurance covers the lawyer's fees if the court is called upon to clarify the question of fault.",
