Marion, Mats and Ricarda would now like to launch a specific gym theft insurance policy. Only the contents of purses are to be insured. The three of them expect around 300 pupils to take out this insurance. Various questions still need to be clarified: For example, how high should the premium and the highest possible claim amount to be paid out be? Advise Marion, Mats and Ricarda.",

With a premium of CHF 30, Marion, Mats and Ricarda would then make neither a profit nor a loss. If the calculation is too tight, the three insurance providers run the risk of making losses. They must therefore periodically analyze the claims according to frequency and size.",
