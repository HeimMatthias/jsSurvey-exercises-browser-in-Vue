In this case, the decision was made to react very quickly, i.e. the retirement age for women will be gradually increased as early as 2025. This means that a woman born in 1961 will receive her AHV pension 3 months later in 2025 than before.",

              "isRequired": true,
              "correctAnswer": "A further increase in the reference age for men and women is generally expected for the AHV (horizon approx. 70 years); increase in contribution payments (relative and therefore absolute). The reduction in payouts for high earners could become an issue.  \nA further reduction in the conversion rate will be realistic for the BV, as will an increase in the reference age. Part-time positions often do not reach the BV limit. These employees will later lack BV, which can promote poverty in old age. Further measures will probably be necessary here (e.g. affiliation to the BV for salaries below the BV limit).",
