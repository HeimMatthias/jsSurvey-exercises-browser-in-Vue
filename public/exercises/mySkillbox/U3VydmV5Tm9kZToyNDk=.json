It is therefore important that the media monitor the government, expose any abuses, but also keep the population well informed so that people can understand the background to the state of emergency and assess whether the government measures (curfew, closure of stores, ban on gatherings, etc.) are justified and proportionate. The media should also monitor whether the government is relinquishing its powers and whether democratic conditions are being restored.\n",
