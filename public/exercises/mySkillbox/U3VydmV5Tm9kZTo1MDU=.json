The production of new machine and system parts has not been one of my core tasks so far. I would like to learn more in this area. Until a year ago, I hosted a successful YouTube channel with 15,000 subscribers, where I published tutorials for simple car repair work. However, I had to give up this hobby due to time constraints. I would like to incorporate the strategies and skills I was able to acquire into my new job. I am very familiar with the fields of pneumatics and hydraulics; they formed the basis for my core tasks at Trisa AG. ",
