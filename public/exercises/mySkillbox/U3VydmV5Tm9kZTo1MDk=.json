To do this, you need the 2nd pillar (pension fund) and possibly the 3rd pillar (private pension provision). The AHV only covers basic needs such as housing and food (subsistence). Additional information: In cases where the AHV and other income are not sufficient to cover the minimum cost of living, those affected receive support from the state (so-called supplementary benefits).",
