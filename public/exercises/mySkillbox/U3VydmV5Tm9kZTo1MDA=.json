His notice of termination will reach the tenants on December 1 at the earliest. However, this is too late to give notice on February 1, as the notice period does not start until December 31, which means that the end of the tenancy is postponed to March 31. Additional note for interested parties: Some tenants will certainly demand a so-called tenant extension. This will mean that Mr. Garbani will most likely not be able to start the renovation work on 1 April. A tenant extension is intended to give a tenant more time to find a new apartment if the termination of the contract would result in hardship for her or her family that cannot be justified by the landlord's interests.",
